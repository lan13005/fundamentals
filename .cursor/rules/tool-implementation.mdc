# How to implement a tool
The overall goal is to work backwards. Whenever you want to implement a new piece of code you should:
1. Understand the overall goal of the code.
2. Write a specific test that checks the code is working as expected.
3. Implement the code following Best Practices in [general.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general.mdc)
4. Run the specific test to ensure it passes and reiterate until it does.

## Required File Updates
When adding new functionality, you MUST update all of the following files:
- [test_integration.py](mdc:tests/test_integration.py): Add or update integration tests for the new functionality.
- [server.py](mdc:fundamentals/server.py): Register new tools and update server configuration if needed.
- [tools.py](mdc:fundamentals/tools.py): Implement the new tool functionality.
- [__init__.py](mdc:fundamentals/__init__.py): Update package exports and version if needed.

All changes must be coordinated across these files to ensure proper functionality and test coverage.

## MCP Tool Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Tool Structure
- Use FastMCP's `@tool` decorator to expose Python functions as MCP tools
- Follow single responsibility principle for each tool
- Use type hints for all parameters and return values
- Implement proper error handling using custom exceptions
- Use Pydantic models for complex data structures

### 2. Documentation
- Clear function and parameter documentation using docstrings
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Document any assumptions or limitations
- Specify error conditions and handling
- Follow Google-style docstring format

### 3. Security Considerations
- Validate all input parameters using Pydantic
- Sanitize any user-provided data
- Implement proper access controls
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Handle sensitive data appropriately
- Use environment variables for configuration

### 4. Performance Guidelines
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Optimize for common use cases
- Monitor resource usage
- Implement timeouts for long-running operations
- Use connection pooling for database operations

### 5. Error Handling
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Implement proper logging using rich console log
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Include retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Use context managers for resource cleanup

### 6. Maintenance
- Include monitoring and logging using rich console log

# Example MCP Tool and Test
- Follow the structure of these examples when making modifications to the codebase
- Example MCP Tool can be found in [tools.py](mdc:fundamentals/tools.py)
- Corresponding example test can be found in [test_integration.py](mdc:tests/test_integration.py)
